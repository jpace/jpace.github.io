<h2>FAQ (yes, a FAQ)</h2>

<h3>Okay, so what's the building on your Github site?</h3>

<blockquote>The name on the building, which can be faintly seen, is "Ruby Store", which is located
in Ruby, Wisconsin. I took the photo in March 2016, and thought it appropriate, given that many of
my projects are in Ruby, which is also my preferred language.</blockquote>

<h3>Egads, how old are you?</h3>

<blockquote>Old enough to remember Arpanet.</blockquote>

<h3>No blinking text? No marquee scrawl?</h3>

<blockquote>Patience.</blockquote>
