<h2>FAQ</h2>

<p>Okay, so what's the building on your Github site?</p>

<p>The name on the building, which can be faintly seen, is "Ruby Store", which is located in Ruby,
Wisconsin. I took the photo in March 2016, and thought it appropriate, given that many of my
  projects are in Ruby, which is also my preferred language.</p>
